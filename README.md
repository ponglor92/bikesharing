# bikesharing
## Overview of the Project
### With the knowledge and material learned from chapter 14, the module challenge is to further convince the investors that a bike- sharing program in Des Moines will be a great business proposal. Using pandas, tableau and VS code, I created visualizations that showed:
-	The length of time it took for bikes to get checked out for all riders and genders,
-	The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week,
-	And, the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
-	For Number to Gender Strings, instead of having it labeled unknown, male and female, it is 0, 1, 2. 
-	0 = UNKNOWN
-	1= MALE
-	2= FEMALE

•	As seen in the graph above, majority of the users checked out a bike during the first 30 minutes. With bikes being checked out so quick and at such a high rate, the company would need to make sure there are enough bikes for users in case there is a shortage. However, we can see how much income is coming with the amount  being checked out so fast.

•	With zero being unknown, 1 being males, and 2 being females; this image shows that males are the users that check out bikes the most compared to females and unknown population.

•	Looking at the weekday schedule, it seems most rides during the weekdays are either early in the morning from 8-9a and later in the evening around 5-7pm. With that being said, it could be that this bike sharing program is used to commute to and from workplace.

•	As shown above, with 0 being UNKNOWN, 1 being MALE, and 2 being FEMALE; it seems that male subscribers used bikes the most on Thursday and Friday. For the non- subscribers, it is seen that there was higher usage of bikes on Saturday for the UNKNOWN (0).

•	With the weekday color schedule, it shows that MALES (1) use the bike sharing program more to commute to and from work, along with just using it on the weekends. 

## Summary
### After completing all of the visualizations on Tableau, it is in favor that male tend to use bikes more as a way to commute, or just to ride in general compared to females and unknown population. It stood out to me that Thursday was the day with most usage of bikes compared to any other day. Overall, I think creating this bike- sharing program in a different city benefit the company a lot because the information above shows that there are a lot of users and customers who are willing to check out bikes and use them for the day. Two other visualization I would make based off the datasets I created are: a breakdown of the genders checking out bikes and a dataset showing bike utilization.

o	This pie chart shows the overall population usage, and which population uses bike more compared to another. With red (0) being UNKNOWN, orange (1) being MALE, and blue (2) being FEMALE. 
-	2nd visualization: Bike Utilization

o	This chart shows how some bikes (with its number ID) is used many times for hours and how some bukes aren’t used as much or not even at all.
